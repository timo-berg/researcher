## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="timo.jpg">

Hi! I'm an undergrad student in mathematics at the TU Berlin. I am also a research assistant at the <a href="https://www.bpn.tu-berlin.de/menue/biopsychologie_und_neuroergonomie/parameter/en/" target="_blank">Gramann lab</a> and currently in San Diego as a visiting researcher at <a href="https://sccn.ucsd.edu/" target="_blank">SCCN</a> under the supervision of Dr. Iversen.

## Research

My research interest is in spatial navigation, especially path integration. I am currently working on a project the contribution of proprioceptipve information in path integration in humans. 
Furthermore I am interested in data analysis methods and tools that can help researchers in their work. One side project of mine is an <a href="https://github.com/timo-berg/eegraw_explorer" target="_blank">EEG-data explorer</a> which is in a very early stage yet. 

Here is a preview of the current state:

## Interests
I'm a big fan of philosophy and psychoanalysis especially their existentialist currents. I also enjoy calligraphy but I'm not really good at it (yet). My biggest passion, however, are orangutans ðŸ¦§. People ask me why, but I think a quick <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=orangutan+baby&tbm=isch" target="_blank">Google search</a> should be enough of an explanation.
