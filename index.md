## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="timo.jpg">

Hi! I am an undergrad student in mathematics at the TU Berlin. I am also a research assistant at the [Gramann lab](https://www.bpn.tu-berlin.de/menue/biopsychologie_und_neuroergonomie/parameter/en/).

## Research

I am currently working on an experiment on spatial navigation. Combining EEG and Virtual-Reality(VR) I am investigating the contribution of proprioceptipve information in path integration.
The project is currently in the data collection phase. More info will be added as the experiment progresses.

## Interests

My broader interests are in data anlysis methods. Thinking about new approaches to extract information from a complex data set is what I love most.
I have experience with various programming languages (descending by level of expertise): Matlab, Python, C# (Unity), R, and Julia.
